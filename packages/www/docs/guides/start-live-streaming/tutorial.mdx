# Start live streaming with Livepeer.com

There are multiple ways to livestream with Livepeer.com. The only prerequisite
for using Livepeer.com is to be able to create an RTMP stream.

You can integrate your streaming application directly with the Livepeer.com API.
Or you can use the Livepeer.com Dashboard to live stream without writing any
code.

In this quick tutorial, you will learn how to create a unique stream object,
broadcast live video content and playback your live stream with Livepeer.com.

## Step 1: Create a stream

Login to the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and navigate to the Streams page,
[livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams),
located in the left-hand menu. Click on the "+ Create stream" button on the top
right corner. When you name your stream, pick a unique name and include URL
compatible characters only.

Then you’ll be redirected to a detailed page with information about your new
stream. Keep this page open. You will need this information for configuring your
broadcasting software in step 2 and playing back your live stream in step 3.

## Step 2 (option 1): Go live using OBS

### Getting started

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is the way that most users stream into Livepeer
because it is easy to use and offers a high degree of customization. OBS is open
source and free to use. Livepeer also works with similar video encoders such as
[Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/).


### What you'll need to get started:

- [ ] Livepeer Video Services account

- [ ] An ingest URL and a stream key

- [ ] OBS software

### Livepeer Video Services

Visit our guide
[Create a stream](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/create-a-stream#no-code-stream-creation-with-the-livepeercom-dashboard)
to learn how to create a video stream.

### OBS

**Step 1:** Download the version of [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for your
operating system

_In this example, macOS will be used_

**Step 2:** Open OBS and create a source

Click the **+ icon** under sources and select **Video Capture Device** if you’d
like to stream using a camera or webcam. If you’d like to stream a browser
window, select **Window Capture**.

_Give the device a name_

![OBS3](/img/docs/obs/OBS3.png)

**Step 3:** Go to the settings

- Select **Stream** settings
- Select **custom** for services
- Copy and paste the **RTMP ingest URL** and **Stream Key** and paste it into
  the **“Server”** and **“Stream Key”** fields.

  - RTMP ingest URL and Stream Key can be found on the dashboard on the Stream
    Detail page after creating a stream or in the API.

**Step 4:** Select the Output settings and the Streaming tab

- In the Output Mode select Advance
- Set the keyframe interval to 2 seconds
- Save your settings

![OBS5](/img/docs/obs/OBS5.png)

**Step 5:** Stream and check output

After saving your settings, OBS will return to the stream console. Press start
streaming from the output you selected in Step 2.

Navigate to the Livepeer Dashboard, login, and select the stream name that
you’re currently using, which should now be marked as “Active.” Under the Health
tab, the video you’re streaming in through OBS should be visible.

To preview the stream in the browser, a video player is required. There are
several options to display the live stream in the browser.
[Visit our tutorial on Video playback in your app](https://livepeer.com/docs/guides/application-development/video-playback-in-your-app)
to learn more.

## Step 2 (option 2): Go live using in-browser broadcaster

If downloading OBS feels cumbersome, there are a few in-browser broadcaster
options. Livepeer.com users have had success with
[Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/) or
[Restream Studio](https://restream.io/).

To use Streamyard with Livepeer:

1. Pick "Destinations"
2. Click "Add a destination"
3. Pick "Custom RTMP"
4. Input `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live` in the "RTMP Server URL" text field.
5. Copy your stream key into the "Stream key" field
6. Input a name for the stream in "Nickname"
7. Click "Add RTMP server"
8. When you are ready to start your live stream, click "Create a broadcast" and
   pick the destination you just created, enter the studio, and click the "Go
   live" button.

To use Restream.io studio with Livepeer:

1. Click "Add channel"
2. Pick "Custom RTMP"
3. Input `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live` in the "RTMP URL" text field.
4. Copy your stream key into the "Stream key" field
5. Click "Enter Live Studio"
6. When you are ready to start your live stream, click the "Go Live" button.

## Step 3: Playback your live stream

Navigate to your stream detail page in the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and copy the
Playback URL. The playback URL is an M3U8 file, the basis for the HTTP Live
Streaming (HLS) format.

Livepeer.com doesn’t have it’s own player, but works with open source and 3rd
party players. For this tutorial, we will use
[Theo Player’s demo player](https://demo.theoplayer.com/test-your-stream-with-statistics).

Paste your playback URL in the text field at the top of Theo Player’s demo
player and click to load your stream. You may need to also press the Play button
in the player.

That’s it! Streaming with Livepeer.com is that simple. To get in touch, fill out
a [contact form](/contact).
