# Start live streaming with Livepeer.com

There are multiple ways to livestream with Livepeer.com. The only prerequisite
for using Livepeer.com is to be able to create an RTMP stream.

You can integrate your streaming application directly with the Livepeer.com API.
Or you can use the Livepeer.com Dashboard to live stream without writing any
code.

In this quick tutorial, you will learn how to create a unique stream object,
broadcast live video content and playback your live stream with Livepeer.com.

## Step 1: Create a stream

Login to the Livepeer.com Dashboard, and navigate to the Streams page,
[livepeer.com/dashboard/streams](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams),
located in the left-hand menu. Click on the `+ Create stream` button on the top
right corner. When you name your stream, pick a unique name and include URL
compatible characters only.

Then you’ll be redirected to a detailed page with information about your new
stream. Keep this page open. You will need this information for configuring your
broadcasting software in step 2 and playing back your live stream in step 3.

## Step 2 (option 1): Go live using OBS

OBS is free and open source software for live streaming.
[Download and install OBS.](https://obsproject.com/download)

Before streaming, we need to configure OBS. Click on Settings in the lower right
corner.

**Set the keyframe interval**

1. In the Settings sidebar menu, select Output.
2. At the top, select Advanced from the Output Mode dropdown.
3. In the Keyframe Interval row, input 2 in the text field.

**Configure OBS to point to Livepeer.com’s RTMP ingest URL**

1. In the Setting sidebar menu, select Stream.
2. At the top, select Custom from the Service dropdown menu.
3. Input the ingest URL `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live` in the Server text
   field.
4. Navigate to the stream detail page, click the “Reveal stream key” button, and
   copy the stream key.
5. Navigate back to OBS, and paste your stream key into the Stream Key text
   field.
6. Confirm the Use Authentication checkbox is unchecked.
7. Click OK in the lower right corner to save your updated server and keyframe
   interval settings.

## Step 2 (option 2): Go live using in-browser streaming

If downloading OBS feels cumbersome, you can stream in the browser by using
Livepeer's WebRTMP- SDK

3. Start a stream your
   [Livepeer Streams Dashboard](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/streams)
4. Run the appication

## Step 3: Playback your live stream

Navigate to your stream detail page in the Livepeer.com dashboard, and copy the
Playback URL. The playback URL is an M3U8 file, the basis for the HTTP Live
Streaming (HLS) format.

_\*Safari browser does support HLS natively, copying and pasting the playback
URL in the browser will work._

Livepeer.com doesn’t have it’s own player, but you can create your own video
player in your applciation or use 3rd party open source players.

** Creating a video player**

- Visit our tutorial on
  [building a video player](https://github.com/codentell/livepeer-player-tutorial)

**Using a 3rd party player**

You can use 3rd party players in your application if creating your own video
player is more work. Here are a couple of options along with their test players
where you can view your live stream by inserting the playback URL
